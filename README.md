# Arduino-RPS (About) 
This is the code for a free-time project (which ultimately failed / is still in progress) in which users would play the classic game 'Rock Paper Scissors'  using an Arduino controlled electrical circuit. 

# Project Title
‘Rock Paper Scissors’ Electrical Circuit 

# Tools Used
Arduino Uno, Arduino IDE, Arduino language, Fritzing and LEDs, Pushbuttons, Breadboard and Wires 

# Description
This was an ambitious project I am yet to finish. The idea was essentially a ‘Rock-Paper-Scissors’ game played on an electronic circuit. I designed various versions of the circuit using Fritzing and programmed the Arduino Uno’s microcontroller (ATmega328P) using the Arduino IDE. I was unable to implement the circuit’s input but was able to test the intended game-logic by using a simulation sketch which I wrote myself to mimic the circuit being played.
